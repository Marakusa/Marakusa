### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Markus and I'm from Finland. I like to spend my free time playing games and developing games.
I'm currently working on a clown shooter video game with a team of 4 people.

I know C#, JavaScript, Python, HTML, PHP, and SQL. If you're interested to play some of my games, you can visit my website at https://aquaticstudios.org

I'll next want to learn more about web development like Node.js would be interesting because PHP is kinda shitty ngl. And I'm interested in C++, but it would take some time to master.
I know the very basics of using a Linux server because I have one.

If you want to contact me...

Well I guess that's it for now ðŸ˜„

Have a wonderful day!
