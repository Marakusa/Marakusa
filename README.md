### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Markus. I'm from Finland. I like to spend my free time playing games and developing games.

I know **C#**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **HTML**, **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **MSSQL**. If you're interested in trying out some of my games, you can visit my website at [aquaticstudios.org](https://aquaticstudios.org).

I'll next want to learn more about web development like Node.js would be interesting. Also, I would someday like to learn C++, but I don't know about it because it would take some time to master.
I have used Linux before, and I know the very basics of hosting a Linux server.

## Currenty developing
- Clown shooter video game with a team of 4 people
- Application where you can save and manage your code snippets
- An open source chat application

Have a wonderful day! ðŸ˜Š
