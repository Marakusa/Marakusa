### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Markus. I'm from Finland. I like to spend my free time playing games and developing games. Also I got a job at Pinja for now besides my studies.

I use **C#**, **JS**, **Node**, **Python**, **HTML**, **PHP** and **SQL**. If you're interested in trying out some of my games, you can visit my website at [aquaticstudios.org](https://aquaticstudios.org).

I have started learning some C++ and I have created two projects where I use it: https://github.com/Marakusa/neptyne and https://github.com/Marakusa/Minesweeper (please forgive the spaghetti mess I'm stil learning it).
Also "I use Arch btw" on my main PC for a while, and I'm somewhat experienced in hosting a Linux server. Linux is the best OS, change my mind.

## Some projects to check out
(Note that these projects are not nearly finished at all, I like to jump from a project to another to learn new things more quickly :D)
- Open source chat application https://github.com/Marakusa/NeoChat
- OpenGL Minecraft clone created with .NET https://github.com/Marakusa/VoxelGame
- Cross-platform 2D .NET game engine https://github.com/Marakusa/Clever2D
