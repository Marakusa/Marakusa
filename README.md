### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Markus and I'm from Finland. I like to spend my free time playing games and developing games.
I'm currently working on a clown shooter video game with a team of 4 people and an application where you can save and manage your code snippets.

I know **C#**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **HTML**, **PHP**, **MySQL** and **MSSQL**. If you're interested to play some of my games, you can visit my website at https://aquaticstudios.org

I'll next want to learn more about web development like Node.js would be interesting. Also I would someday like to learn C++, but i don't know about it because it would take some time to master.
I know the very basics of hosting a Linux server.

If you want to contact me...

Well I guess that's it for now ðŸ˜„

Have a wonderful day!
