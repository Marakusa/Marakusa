### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Markus. I'm from Finland. I like to spend my free time playing games and developing games. I'm working at Pinja and I study at JAMK university of applied sciences to an ICT engineer.

I'm fluent with C#, and with Azure. I can also do some web development and do SQL stuff. I can write some C++ code too.

Well, I guess that's it for now ðŸ˜„

Have a wonderful day! ðŸ˜Š
