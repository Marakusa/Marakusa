### Hi! ğŸ‘‹

My name is Markus. I'm from Finland. I like to spend my free time playing games and developing games. I'm working at Pinja and I study at JAMK university of applied sciences to an ICT engineer.

I use **C#**, **JS**, **Node**, **Python**, **HTML**, **PHP** and **SQL**.

I have started learning some C++ and I have created two projects where I use it: https://github.com/Marakusa/neptyne and https://github.com/Marakusa/Minesweeper (please forgive the spaghetti mess I'm stil learning it).

Well, I guess that's it for now ğŸ˜„

Have a wonderful day! ğŸ˜Š
