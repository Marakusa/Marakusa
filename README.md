### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Markus. I'm from Finland. I like to spend my free time playing games and developing games. Also I got a job at Pinja for now besides my studies.

I use **C#**, **JS**, **Node**, **Python**, **HTML**, **PHP** and **SQL**.

I have started learning some C++ and I have created two projects where I use it: https://github.com/Marakusa/neptyne and https://github.com/Marakusa/Minesweeper (please forgive the spaghetti mess I'm stil learning it).

Also "I use Arch btw" on my main PC for a couple months, and I'm somewhat experienced in hosting a Linux server. Also spread love to Valve for creating Proton and hopefully Steam Deck if it succeeds.

Well, I guess that's it for now ðŸ˜„

Have a wonderful day! ðŸ˜Š
